## Overview
I love to read books and want to share some of my recommendations here.

* [I am a Strange Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop): This is my favorite book of all times.
* [The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise): Loved the emphasis on probabilistic and Bayesian thinking.



Here's what I'm [[Currently Reading]].
