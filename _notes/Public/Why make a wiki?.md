# Why make a wiki?
I wanted to share my thoughts easily on the internet. Primarily, for two reasons. The first being is that writing helps me think better. I find that when I try to write, I need to crystalize my fuzzy thoughts, and typically stream of thought writing is messy so revising text helps me also revise my thought patterns. The second reason is that I also want to deseminate learnings that might be useful to others. I learn from other people's writing and so it feels good to also give back.
